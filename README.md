# 🗺️ Streamer Hunt – Runner vs. Hunter (Map & Joker System)

A file-based **PHP + HTML** project for an IRL  
**“Runner vs. Hunter”** stream game with controlled position reveals.

Designed for **OBS Browser Sources**, manual **Joker reveals** and a secure, server-side game flow.

## 📦 Components

### 🧍‍♂️ Views (Overlays)

- 🗺️ **hunter.html**  
  Map view **for the Hunters**  
  → shows the **Runner position**  
  → position updates:
  - automatically by timer
  - **manually via Hunter Joker**

- 🏃 **runner.html**  
  Map view **for the Runner**  
  → shows the **Hunter position**  
  → **ONLY visible when a Runner Joker is used**  
  → no countdown, no automatic updates

---

### 🔌 Backend

- 🔌 **api.php**  
  Central JSON API:
  - configuration & game state
  - route storage
  - snapshot delivery
  - **Joker reveal actions**
  - Google Directions proxy (distance)

- 🎛️ **control.php**  
  Control panel to:
  - edit game settings
  - start / pause rounds
  - manage runner / hunter IDs

- ⚙️ **config.php**, **game_state.json**  
  File-based configuration & runtime state  
  (intentionally excluded from public repos)

---

## 🧠 Core Concept

### 🔍 Snapshots instead of live tracking

Positions are **not streamed live** to the opponents.

Instead:
- positions are written to **snapshot JSON files**
- views poll these snapshots
- **Jokers force a snapshot update**

This guarantees:
- fair gameplay
- no timer manipulation
- deterministic reveals

---

## 📂 Snapshot Files

| File | Contains | Used by |
|----|--------|--------|
| runner_snapshot.json | Runner position | hunter.html |
| hunter_snapshot.json | Hunter position | runner.html |

---

## 🃏 Joker System

### 🎯 Hunter Joker (Hunters reveal the Runner)

```
GET api.php?action=hunter_reveal_now
```

**Effect:**
- updates `runner_snapshot.json`
- `hunter.html` immediately shows the Runner position
- countdown continues normally

---

### 🏃 Runner Joker (Runner reveals the Hunters)

```
GET api.php?action=runner_reveal_now
```

**Effect:**
- updates `hunter_snapshot.json`
- `runner.html` immediately shows the Hunter position
- stays visible until the next Runner Joker

---

### 🔐 Security

Both Joker endpoints are **IP-restricted** via:

```php
"allowed_ip" => "YOUR_ALLOWED_IP"
```
